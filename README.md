# SimpleMusicPlayer

Implementation of a one screen music player, with MediaController, MediaPlayer running in service class and media style notificaitons.

The app ceate a list of audio files saved on the device and show them on the sceen, sorted alphabetically. it has two floating buttons - 
one to play all the songs from first to last (and then start again), the other to shuffle all the songs and play them in a random order.
If you click on a song - it will play it (and then the next one on the list etc..).
Once you click on a song or one of the buttons a MediaController appears on the buttom of the screen and the songs' name at the top.
Also, media styled notification will appear on the action bar.
The mediaPlayer service will continue to run in the backgroud - allowing the user to controll the music (pause or play, go to next or 
previous song). The user can go back to the app screen by pressing on the notification icon.
if you want to close the player - you can do it by clicking on the cancel button (x) in the notification.
